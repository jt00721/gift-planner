# gift-planner
The Gift Planner Web App will help users track gift ideas for different occasions and people. Users will be able to add, edit, and organize gifts, set budgets, and mark gifts as purchased.

## Core Goals:

- Add, edit, and delete gift ideas.
- Associate gifts with recipients and occasions (e.g., birthdays, Christmas).
- Track gift budgets and spending.
- Mark gifts as purchased or pending.
- Build a clean and simple UI for easy navigation.

## Project Breakdown by Day

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: Project is initialized & scope is well-defined.

### Set Up Database & Models

âœ… Goals:

    Design the relational database schema using SQLite/PostgreSQL.

âœ… Tasks:

    Define relationships (one recipient can have multiple gifts, one occasion can have multiple gifts).
    Implement database migrations & seed some test data.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: Database schema is set up and structured properly.

### Implement Backend Logic (CRUD Operations)

âœ… Goals:

    Build backend functionality for adding, editing, deleting, and retrieving gifts.

âœ… Tasks:

    Create API endpoints for handling gift data:
        POST /gifts â†’ Add a new gift

        PUT /gifts/:id â†’ Edit a gift
        DELETE /gifts/:id â†’ Remove a gift

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: Backend logic fully functional with CRUD operations.

### Build the UI & Connect to Backend

âœ… Goals:

    Create HTML templates & frontend layout.
    Connect UI to backend API.

âœ… Tasks:

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: Users can view and add gifts via the UI.

### Implement Budget Tracking & Gift Status

âœ… Goals:

    Track total spending vs. budget.
    Allow users to mark gifts as purchased or pending.

âœ… Tasks:

    Add a budget column to the Gifts table.
    Implement a toggle button for setting a giftâ€™s status (purchased or pending).
    Display budget progress bar (e.g., "Youâ€™ve spent $50 out of $200").

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: Users can track gift spending & manage gift status.

### Testing, Debugging & UI Enhancements

âœ… Goals:

    Ensure everything is working smoothly & improve the UI.

âœ… Tasks:

    Test adding, editing, deleting gifts & budget calculations.
    Fix bugs & responsiveness issues.
    Apply CSS improvements to refine the UI.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: A clean, polished, and fully working Gift Planner.

### Final Testing & Project Wrap-Up

âœ… Goals:

    Perform final testing & optimizations.
    Record content for social media.

âœ… Tasks:

    Stress-test the app (e.g., add multiple gifts, test edge cases).
    Ensure database queries are optimized.
    Record a recap video showing how the Gift Planner works.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverable: Final working Gift Planner ready for deployment & content creation.
